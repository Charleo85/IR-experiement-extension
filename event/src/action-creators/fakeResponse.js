      " Weight & Portability - It's nice and small, easy to carry around in hand as well as light on the back": [
        "Great Chromebook! Bought as a replacement for my Lenovo Ideapad 310, AMD A12, 8GB Ram. The main reason for the replacement was battery life. Only getting 2-3 hours on the Lenovo, I needed something that could handle my digital nomad lifestyle. PROS: Battery Life - You can easily get 8-9 hours with moderate usage. Performance - I was a tad bit concerned with this factor, but with: ----- 21 tabs open ----- Keypress Editior (coding app from Chrome Store) ----- Webserver for Chome (running a local server for web dev, from Chrome Store) ----- Box SVG (creating & editing vector graphics app from Chrome Store) ----- Polarr (a really good image editior from Chrome Store) ----- Enjoy Music Player (another Chrome Store app) I haven't experienced any significant slow downs. Opening large SVG files or any other larger file, slows the system for a second or two (acceptable). Keyboard - I love typing on this keyboard. Even though it's smaller than my Lenovo, I type faster. Keys are well spaced and feel good to press. Also the key font size is a small aesthetic that you'll appreciate. Build Quality - I won't lie, it's ugly, but it feels very solid in hand. I'm not moving it around like it's a new born baby, as I was with my Lenovo. I can quickly take it out my backpack and slap it on a desk. All the ports feel strong and sturdy. My flash drive does not wiggle while inserted. Screen - It's good for the price, nice matte finish. I haven't had the urge to go back to my Lenovo (15.6) to watch a video or movie. It gets bright and dim to my satisfaction, nuff said. Charge Time - A fast charging device wasn't on my feature list, but this baby is fully charged from 35% in less than 1 hour. Better than my lenovo...I'll take it. Trackpad - It does what I expect and is perfectly placed. My only gripe is how loud actual clicks are, everyone at Starbucks will know when you double-click. Chrome OS - FYI, I'm coming from Ubuntu Desktop. From a bird's eye view Chrome OS may seem limited, but once you dig around the Chrome Store, you'll start finding apps for all your problems and fairly decent app replacements. Furthermore, there are a plethora of web apps outside the Chrome Store to compensate most people's unique necessities. Chrome OS + Google Play - In my opinion these two paired eliminate the \"OS Limits\". If you ever used Android, then you'll know there's an app for everything. I personally haven't even needed the Play Store yet, so I actually disabled it. Storage - I thought this would be an issue, but Google Drive is integrated very well. You get 120GB free for 2 years. You can also expand your local memory with SD card or flash drive. I always keep a flash drive backup. Speakers - As you can tell, I'm not super picky. These speakers get the job done, better than my Lenovo. I don't find myself plugging in my headphones to hear things better as I do with my phone and laptop. They get loud enough for me. Wifi - This was another huge issue I had with my Lenovo, mainly because I was using linux. Asus definitely delivers, connections are always strong and never drop. I'm using this Chromebook in the same locations as I did with the Lenovo. Bluetooth - I couldn't get it to connect with my phone. The pair would instantly drop. I haven't looked for a solution. I sure a bluetooth mouse or headset will work. It's well documented that not all phones pair with Chromebooks. Weight & Portability - It's nice and small, easy to carry around in hand as well as light on the back. Has a great rubber strip on bottom, that not only holds grip on tables and laps better than any other laptop I've owned, but allows it to be carried around like a spiraled notebook. Love Factor - It may be ugly, but I just love using it. It can do more than my phone and suitably replaces my laptop. Easy to carry around, not fragile, well built. It's the perfect piece of technology to augment yourself. Overall: Battery Life = 10 Performance = 9 Keyboard = 10 Build Quality = 10 Screen = 8 Charge Time = 10 Trackpad = 8 Chrome OS = 9 Storage (cloud) = 10 Speakers = 8 WIFI = 10 Bluetooth = no contest Weight & Portability = 10 Love Factor = 10 TOTAL 122/130 (excluding bluetooth) -------------------------------- 94% Chance I think you'll like this Chromebook",

It is also very minimal but I like that too. It is put together very well and there are no flimsy plastic vents that will easily break or anything like that. So far it seems like it is built to last without being super bulky and ugly. It also does not have a disc drive, if that is something you are looking for and it is made by google chrome so it it doesn't opperate off of windows or like a Mac but with a simple google chrome system which is really easy to use and pretty cool. I will basically use it to go online and to watch Netflix so I don't need it to do a bunch and it will serve that purpose perfectly. If you are looking for something minimalistic (but not completely unattractive), easy to use, and durable that doesn't take up a lot of space this is a great little laptop. I could see it being perfect for older people that aren't tech savvy or young students- or for someone like me that wants something affordable, simple and that wont break with everyday use.",

Touchpad is responsive and works well inexpensive, for the specs this is one of the best bang for you buck deals on a Chromebook (Would be nice) It would be cool if there was a version that had a back lit keyboard or touchscreen but I don't mind since it's lighter and has a better battery life this way. (Cons) What I really wish this Chromebook had was a better screen, it has poor contrast and my eyes get tired if I look at it for an extended period of time. It looks really poor when viewing from any angle other than straight on. If this Chromebook had a 1080p screen it would be pretty much perfect. If they offered one with a 1080p screen I would buy it right now.",

        "I've had various Apple Macbooks for the past 10+ years and I'm currently a 1st year grad student. The majority of my work has been internet based for at least the past 3 years, so I decided why not do some research and see if I can get by using something other than a Macbook and save myself $600+. I've had this guy for 2 weeks and here are the pros and cons I've come across so far: PROS: -light, portable, SUPER easy to use, SIMPLICITY IS KEY...just log in to your google account and you're ready to go -if you have your life through google apps (photos, drive, gmail, play[music]), you are good to go on any computer and will basically never have to worry about backing up your life (as long as you have internet...but I mean realistically, who doesn't have internet these days?...) -I haven't tried dropping it or pouring water on it yet (don't plan to test out that feature), but the overall security of that protection is peace of mind -turns on and off super QUICK and when you open the laptop, you're connected to WiFi before you can even check if you're connected -screen brightness exceeded my expectations, the matte screen might give a little glare from a window or something but it's not nearly as bad as Macbook's glass screens -larger (and blue!) text on the keyboard is a nice touch -battery life is pretty good...I mean if you're opening up tabs upon tabs surfing the web, anything is going to die quick, but this little guy fully charges up FAST you'll never skip a beat -side speakers are nice and i think they're pretty loud for the size of this guy -a normal HDMI outlet is GENIUS...now I don't hafta worry about having an adapter from my Macbook to an HDMI---also connecting to a TV is seamless and the picture quality is nice -netflix and hulu are great and doesn't completely drain my battery after a couple shows like it did on my Macbook CONS: -smaller overall keyboard size takes some getting used to -trackpad also took some getting used to...I kept finding my fingers didn't smoothly slide over it like it does on Macbooks and it's smaller than I'm used to -overall less keys on the keyboard so some of your normal functions won't work, or you'll need to google certain shortcuts, but I still like the simplicity -keyboard is NOT backlit -loading multiple tabs is slow...not dreadfully slow, but it definitely lags, and if you do open up multiple tabs, go get a drink or a snack because it takes a hot second for everything to be fully loaded -typing is louder than on Apple devices -if you need something offline, you better make sure it's set to work in offline mode or else you're SOL -not really iPhone compatible...it'll charge it, but it constantly asks me to allow the Chromebook to access my phone...idk how many times I can click Allow for it to stop asking me -no iTunes...that's what google Play is for...I'm still working on what I plan to do with this issue but for me, iTunes is not life -I haven't tried it out yet, but I've read you can't use an external optical drive to watch movies or burn disks...it just doesn't do that...and TBH, if you needed to burn a CD or something, a Chromebook shouldn't be your first option -Google Docs, Drive, Cal, Play all take some getting used to, but once you're set up, you're good -little storage...but your stuff is saved to your Drive. if you did wants more internal storage, you can always get an SD card or external HD Overall, I really do like this little guy and can't believe how freaking budget friendly it is! And the best part is, if I ever need a new one, I can just go get one, log into google, and it's like I never left. No stress and completely worth your $200. If you're on the fence about it, my only suggestion is to make sure you're completely ready to make the switch to ALL google (photos and music were my main concerns) and you'll be fine.

I have had no problems so far. It is a joy to use. Buyers should be told in clear terms that a 16 Gb machine such as this will have 8 Gb of usable memory available. The operating system takes up about 8 Gb. This is easily accommodated with an SDHC card, and I was aware I would have to purchase memory. But no one mentioned that operating system gobbles up 50% of the machine's memory. My expectations were totally met by this machine. I never thought I could get Apps from the Google Play Store - those are for android machines... However, Google is working to make Apps available and this machine is in \"Beta\" for Apps. Had I realized this, I might have spent a little more, or looked at other machines that already have Google apps available. Please do not take this as criticisms of this machine, its just information. The Asus C202SA is well worth the money, and only will get better with implementation of the Google Play connection. I would buy it again. Update: August 24, 2017 The latest update of Chrome Operating System included the ability get and run Apps from the Android App Store. Many Apps are available, but not all of them as some developers are not ready. But, now that I have it, I'm not sure why I was so excited about getting this feature. I checked every App I have on my Phone, and it is just as easy using them from a Chrome web page as it is from an App. It is nice having a separate icon and a single click, but the App and the Web page are equally suited for my use.",

        "I purchased my ASUS Chromebook when after having shoulder surgery I realized that it was impossible for me to lift the gaming laptop I purchased to keep me occupied for the six weeks I would be recuperating with the use of only one arm. After 3 weeks of nothing but Netflix and Amazon Prime and fighting with the kids over the Ipad I decided I would look into a cheap alternative to my laptop. This ASUS wasn't steep in price and I figured I can just give it to the kids to use once I am back to life. I had heard about Chromebooks being slow and limiting but that could not be further from the truth. The SPEED IS FAST! I don't notice any difference between the Chromebook and other laptops I have used in the past and that is when I have up to five or six (or more) tabs open. True you can't use software such as Microsoft Word or Office which makes it possible to do work off line but with Google docs that really doesn't bother me. I have wifi at home and I'm not going anywhere when I can't even brush my own hair. Honestly almost everywhere you might want to do some work online there is free wifi available. Movie streaming is working just great. I have noticed that it has taken a little longer for some video on youtube or Buzzfeed to load but not enough to be a problem. Another real benefit of this Chromebook is the size and ease of use. I have the use of only one hand right now with the exception of having a few minutes per day while doing \"exercises\" with my arm,(which is why I can type this review!). This Chromebook is as easy to lift and carry around with one hand as the Ipad and it is no problem with getting the top open with just one hand. This little thing is tough and I don't feel any give as if I were tensing the hinges when pulling open the top like I would on my old laptop. It doesn't sway or bend or feel cheap at all. The rubber grip around the edges also makes me feel more at ease with moving it around all day and opening and closing it. The very biggest surprise though has come from the keyboard. I love to write and have had a really hard time with hand and wrist pain when typing on a flat keyboard as opposed to mechanical. With this the KEYBOARD IS FANTASTIC FOR TYPING! The keys have a clean click and I can type much faster than on the horrible keyboard of my old Toshiba Satellite. The keyboard is smaller than a larger computer but the only key I have noticed missing is the caps lock. I have read some complaints about the touch pad but I have had no issues with it whatsoever. So, would I buy it again? In a heart beat. In fact I wish I had known how great a $200.00 little laptop could be. And it is like a small laptop and nothing like a tablet with a keyboard.",

        "It is much smaller than I expected, about the size of a Mac book and the screen it about the size of a tablet screen- which put me off at first but it is super light and stores easily. It is also very minimal but I like that too. It is put together very well and there are no flimsy plastic vents that will easily break or anything like that. So far it seems like it is built to last without being super bulky and ugly. It also does not have a disc drive, if that is something you are looking for and it is made by google chrome so it it doesn't opperate off of windows or like a Mac but with a simple google chrome system which is really easy to use and pretty cool. I will basically use it to go online and to watch Netflix so I don't need it to do a bunch and it will serve that purpose perfectly. If you are looking for something minimalistic (but not completely unattractive), easy to use, and durable that doesn't take up a lot of space this is a great little laptop. I could see it being perfect for older people that aren't tech savvy or young students- or for someone like me that wants something affordable, simple and that wont break with everyday use.",

      " By the way, as of March 16 2017 this unit did auto update to version 56, which does reportedly allow play store installation if you are willing to go out on a limb manually installing \u2018pre-beta\u2019 software \u2013 but if you are waiting for formal OS support of play store apps progress is very slow": [
        "I have not received the unit yet, I'll update the rating when I've used the unit for awhile, but here is some useful info. If you are interested in the 'fixability' of the unit, a site called IfixIt has a complete disassembly of an Asus C202 with pictures -- nothing is glued together, all you need are a couple small phillips screwdrivers and the ubiquitous plastic cell phone case pry tool. Looks easy to repair/replace parts to me. I like to look over a user manual BEFORE I buy tech, but if you search for 'Asus C202 manual' all you will find is a .pdf of a single sheet like they package with a watch. However, searching for 'Asus C300 Chromebook User Manual' leads to a site dicdnet.asus.com with a .pdf \"Notebook PC - E-Manual for Chromebook\" dated April 2014, which although using the C300 model as an example is actually a 90 page general Asus Chromebook user manual. I'm sure a specific (and possibly more recent) manual will come pre-installed on the C202 but if you want some pre-purchase info here you go. UPDATE 3/15/17: Received unit but so far not so great. First, they say to let unit charge for at least 3 hours before using it. Now my guess is, if I just left it plugged in I could use it after 10-15 minutes of initial charge, but I followed the directions and waited. Then the unit said it had to upgrade to the latest version of Chrome -- OK -- and the progress bar said 30 minutes. It still said 30 minutes about 5 minutes later, at which point I had to close the lid, wondering if that would turn the unit off or not. Sure enough when I opened the unit an hour later I got the same 30 minutes to upgrade message so I closed the lid and went to bed. About 12 hours later I got a chance to try again and this time the unit prompted me to sign in to my google email account - expected but we use long secure passwords on our email accounts, not the kind of password I want to type in every time I turn on a laptop. I found out later that there is an option to log in as a guest which appears to be enabled by default, which may be the preferred method from a privacy point of view if the unit is physically secure, as long as you don't need to buy an app or do anything else tied to a specific google account. Of course the very first thing you want to do is go through all the settings and make sure all the security/privacy settings are what you want. One thing I noticed right away was that I was missing Page Up / Page Down keys. After finding a keyboard shortcut map I tried the key combinations for page up /page down, but they didn't work on Google's own help page -- only moving the cursor in the scrollbar worked. This is not good to have no keyboard navigation. I also noticed there is no delete key. Now you can get that function via a two key press, but delete is such a much used function it should have it's own key -- with the confirming \"Are you sure..\" prompt enabled by default. My conclusions so far: Long delay before intitial use. Sure a Windows laptop would be similar (although the Windows update would occur in the background) due to security software updates and other software updates, but I did not expect any delay with a Chromebook. Needs at least basic step - by - step startup instructions printed in the box. Google obviously thinks a Chromebook is a phone with a keyboard -- basic notebook features like options to set hat happens when you close the lid, and basic keys like pgup, pgdn, and del, limit functionality unnecessarily. Hopefully actual use will prove more positive. UPDATE 3/16/17: This review won\u2019t get past initial impressions as I will be returning the unit \u2013 it just didn\u2019t work out for me. I\u2019m leaving my overall rating at 3 stars, though Asus gets 5 stars for great hardware design and execution. I like the Chromebook concept \u2013 a low power low heat generating processor combined with a small, efficient *nix operating system, but I think Google needs to move further past the hobbyist aspects, like having to use operating system flags to get basic functionality, or having to move beyond beta versions into \u2018canary\u2019 developmental versions to catch up with what (at least my) expectations are now. Then there\u2019s functions deserving dedicated keyboard keys \u2013 at least del, pgup, pgdn, forward and back, all of which can be half size keys so not a space issue. Most importantly is a failure to provide .pdf documentation AND initial turn on step-by-step basic tutorial. I \u2018get\u2019 that Google wants to change things on a more or less continuous basis, so make the .pdf view only. And on initial turn-on there should be a series of splash screens with what to do \u2013 sign in options, security/privacy options, basic keyboard/touchpad/storage/browser/etc. options \u2013 just like Windows. Operating system updates should be followed by screens explaining any changes. Sadly I can\u2019t recommend this for young folks school use if other options are affordable because the interface is different than the Windows/Mac equipment they will be using later. Older kids who are ready to knowledgably multi-platform will find these fascinating, although not as fascinating as playing with full size *nix on a full size platform. For many folks this inexpensive Chromebook will get the job done \u2013 I had no problem surfing and saving files. Given another year of software development incorporating the suggestions above, and including relatively seamless incorporation of most Android apps, this Chromebook might get the job done for me, too. By the way, as of March 16 2017 this unit did auto update to version 56, which does reportedly allow play store installation if you are willing to go out on a limb manually installing \u2018pre-beta\u2019 software \u2013 but if you are waiting for formal OS support of play store apps progress is very slow.",

        "The computational device one buys must serve the buyers particular need. Everyone uses them differently, and so trying to compare them side-by-side is really not relevant. An Architect using CAD programs would need a different device than (say) a writer, or a webmaster, a gamer, video editors, scientists, and so on. Many programs were originally written for Windows platform; that's the OS you'll need then. Some object to a Chromebook because it's cloud based, and technically that's true, but only if you look at it side-by-side with a computer that has hard-drive-stored programs such as MS Office or Mac's iWork, as compared to G-Drive (cloud-stored) programs such as Docs, Sheets, Slides, (etc); all of which can be set to work offline and then syncs when back online. I also use Caret as a basic word processor offline, and, one can use the Gmail offline App, and use a draft as a word processor too. Search also: Run Linux Based Programs on a Chromebook. I walk or bus (do not own/use cars) and so I pack this mere 42-ounce laptop using an and it rests easily on my back, unnoticed.

        "I am a computer tech since 1986 and build and fix computers and laptops. My wife and I both own high end 17\" AMD Windows 10 64 bit laptops with 16 gigs of RAM which perform very well but when we take vacations they are just too big to take along sometimes. While I prefer a Window OS and AMD systems and would rather have a Chromebook with an AMD system versus Intel, they do use much more resources then the Chrome OS and a Chromebook is just fine for our use on trips. Even though 4 gigs of RAM seems small, it is plenty when running the Chrome OS. The Intel Celeron is also a lower end CPU but it works very well in this. We like this so much that we ordered a second one so that we don't need to share.This is a bit heavy for its size but that is because of its sturdy drop resistant design. Love the keyboard and love that it is water resistant. This thing just feels well made and works like it is well designed. I could not have made this better myself. It does come with a 16 gig eMMC which is a bit slower then a SSD, it also works very fast.Another great thing is that ASUS made this so that parts are easy to replace even though I fix laptops so that doesn't matter as much to me.

The other features, such as the spill-proof keys, add to the appeal of the product. Additionally, each Chromebook purchase I've made has included 100 GB of Google Drive storage for two years.
