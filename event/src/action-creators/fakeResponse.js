This laptop seemed to be the ideal replacement since it had. nearly the same specs and was built by a reputable company. I had never. purchased a refurbished laptop before so I was unsure of what to expect. Pros:. * There were some noticable signs of wear and tear but overall the unit was. clean and in good shape. It would never pass for \"new\" but it didn't look. five years old either. * Specs were as advertised. My unit was equiped with a built-in cellular. radio, which had not been mentioned in the specs. * Came with Windows 10 preinstalled. This could just as easilly be a con,. depending on your feelings for Windows :) I promptly wiped the drive,. installed Linux and discarded the included Windows key. Cons:. * None that would reflect on the seller of this device. Misc:. * My first few attempts to start up the notebook resulted in the Windows 10. equivalent of the BSOD. It simply would not boot. Then I plugged in the. power supply and it started up just fine. * The laptop weighs 6 pounds, which is as much as some full sized laptops. It is definitely not as portable as I had hoped. * If you're comfortable tinkering with computers, you can upgrade many of. the components yourself. The CPU can be upgraded to a Core i7, you can. install a backlit keyboard or swap out the HD for an SSD. The DVD can be. replaced with a second hard drive, and the screen can be upgraded to. 1600x900.",

        "I really like my Lenovo Thinkpad and I will tell you why. I recently ordered, a new 2 in 1 \"TabTop type PC. It's not like an older PC (Personal Computer) at all. It is basically a Windows 10 Touchscreen Tablet with a keyboard. It only has 1 USB 3.0 Port so if you use a USB mouse you can't plug in a Flashdrive at the same time. It has a USB 3.1 port but I went to Walmart and Best Buy and there is not a single plug in device you can buy that uses USB 3.1 so it is basically useless until new devices come out utilizing the new USB standard The bios is fixed, that means it wont boot from a cd rom, like for installing Windows 7 or 8.1, or even Widows 10. It won't read from a USB CD rom plugged into the USB Port, it just beeps and locks up the the mouse and keyboard. Can't load or play anything from a CD - Nero, Microsoft Office, Mp3, Mp4 music and videos. You're now supposed to download all your \"apps\" from the Microsoft Store. Thinner and lighter is much about phasing out CD based software, so CD software has to be loaded onto flashdrives. Doable but extra time and expense. I wanted to load Ubuntu as a dual boot, can't do it, Windows 10 only. It looks like this machine represents the future \"brave new world of Microsoft\" It is not a Computer like we have gotten used to. You are limited to the world of MS Windows 10 touchscreen as it is basically, more of a tablet aimed at the Smartphone demographic. My wife's Galaxy Tab seems to be as much or more useable for 1/4 the price. If I wanted to ground her all I would have to do is take away her Galaxy. Now, about the Lenovo, just reverse everything I just said. The Thinkpad T430 is a true PC. You can do all of the things you can't do with the Windows Tablet and more. It will run Windows XP, 7, 8.1 and Windows 10. Without a touchscreen, using a mouse you can just about fully duplicate any Windows 10 function activated by touch, though touch is deemed to be \"way cool\" and more up to date, overall a little faster. The Lenovo Website not only has drivers for every OS and internal device, but how-to Videos abound that show you how to do everything! It acts like a real PC. It's got plenty of ports. i5 CPU and 7200 rpm HD is more than adequate for every day usage though there are two easily accessible places to upgrade to ssd for a total of two terabytes! It just works. Two screws and you can upgrade the RAM and even install a PCIe mSata ssd card, or replace the HD with an ssd, one screw and it slides out, no need to open the covers. It uses a special thinner, 2.5 inch drive so you have to make sure you order the right form factor. The CD rom drive also easily slides out in seconds and is user replaceable. These are all FRU's aka Field Replaceable Units. An old IBM term, (I worked for IBM back in the day). The T430 is one of the most durable, versatile PC's I have ever used. It has all the benefits of \"Old School\" but not really old, without some of the shortercomings of some of the new breed of machines heading down the pike. If you wan't a real PC that does everything you want it to do, then the T430 more than fills the bill. Don't really want to dis TabTop users, just that the PC world is vaguely divided between Old School Windows 7 Right Click mouse and keyboard folks and Touchscreen Smartphone folks; kinda like the Demecans and Republicrats. a sveldt 2.2 lb .5 inch thick new machine versus a 6 lb has everything does everything, comes with a built-in cd rom drive, Old School Laptop. My Granddaughters think I'm a dinosaur, but cute, like Barney. Since you won't see them go 5 minutes without checking their iphone, they automatically gravitate towards the newer MacBook Air and Surface Pro. Located along side the memory slot easily accessible by two screws is an mSata slot. I installed a 256 gb Samsung V-NAND SSD 850 EVO mSATA board. They're available up to 1tb. In my machine there was a screw already in the RH locator post. about a ten second operation with two wires that have to be folded out of the way. The Lenovo copper cooling fan located under the keyboard is relatively large and heavy duty. I didn't notice anything other than a slight temperature increase with the ssd installed. I downloaded both the Samsung cloning and Management software, pretty much a no-brainer. I removed the regular 2.5 inch drive and use it for backup and external storage. There is a definite performance boost and the T430 now performs like a machine costing 3x more. The best of both worlds in my opinion, plus it's built like a tank. Some folks are concerned with weight; I don't see where a few pounds can make that much of a real-world difference when used mainly as a desktop or even as a Laptop, but that's just me. Last time I flew in an airplane it was roomy and comfortable, the stewardesses were all under 40, plus you got a meal flying coach, and no nard-groping. TSA to ruin your day. I bought a new 9 cell battery for $40.00 and some Windows 7 and 8.1 recovery disks from ebay. I decided to give Windows 10 a second look and for the first time I used Cortana. My wife is talking into her tablet so I thought I'd give it a try. She's fast and really smart, (i.e. Cortana), my wife, like me is not so fast anymore. A time-saver when browsing the Internet, so I'm going to stick with 10 for a while and see how it goes. Overall, I'm like the cat who ate the canary. I got a really good machine at a really good price. Upon arrival it looked like a machine that had some use, but not bent or beat-up, better than I expected. Doesn't matter much, as nine times out of ten computers either work, or they don't. This one works as good as new and I'm a happy camper.",

        "Totally impressed with the appearance of the unit when I opened the box. Sure, you can find a few very minor flaws if you break out your magnifying glass, but hey, it's been refurbished, you have to expect that. Setting up the operating system was quite easy if you are computer savvy, but if not, the audio set up instructions are quite helpful. Once the setup was complete, I installed all my apps and allowed the machine to do all of the necessary Windows updates. (This takes a while) After all was said and done, I was very pleased with the speed and operation of the laptop. Now for the \"drawback\", so to speak, you can not \"Register\" Windows because the operating system is specifically for refurbished units and is not available to register. This means that you can not \"Personalize\" the computer with any other wallpapers or any other way you want to change the appearance. You can however, spend $200 for a Windows 10 license if this is your choice, but personally, I can live with it the way it is, and even if you do, you will still have a Lenovo Think Pad in the neighborhood of $500, which is still very inexpensive as opposed to a brand new unit. I recommend this computer to anyone looking to save a few bucks and still have a great computer. Perfect for school. It was delivered one day late, but that was due to the shipping carrier's delay and not the shipper, Blazing Prices.",

        "I really like my Lenovo Thinkpad and I will tell you why. I recently ordered, a new 2 in 1 \"TabTop type PC. It's not like an older PC (Personal Computer) at all. It is basically a Windows 10 Touchscreen Tablet with a keyboard. It only has 1 USB 3.0 Port so if you use a USB mouse you can't plug in a Flashdrive at the same time. It has a USB 3.1 port but I went to Walmart and Best Buy and there is not a single plug in device you can buy that uses USB 3.1 so it is basically useless until new devices come out utilizing the new USB standard The bios is fixed, that means it wont boot from a cd rom, like for installing Windows 7 or 8.1, or even Widows 10. It won't read from a USB CD rom plugged into the USB Port, it just beeps and locks up the the mouse and keyboard. Can't load or play anything from a CD - Nero, Microsoft Office, Mp3, Mp4 music and videos. You're now supposed to download all your \"apps\" from the Microsoft Store. Thinner and lighter is much about phasing out CD based software, so CD software has to be loaded onto flashdrives. Doable but extra time and expense. I wanted to load Ubuntu as a dual boot, can't do it, Windows 10 only. It looks like this machine represents the future \"brave new world of Microsoft\" It is not a Computer like we have gotten used to. You are limited to the world of MS Windows 10 touchscreen as it is basically, more of a tablet aimed at the Smartphone demographic. My wife's Galaxy Tab seems to be as much or more useable for 1/4 the price. If I wanted to ground her all I would have to do is take away her Galaxy. Now, about the Lenovo, just reverse everything I just said. The Thinkpad T430 is a true PC. You can do all of the things you can't do with the Windows Tablet and more. It will run Windows XP, 7, 8.1 and Windows 10. Without a touchscreen, using a mouse you can just about fully duplicate any Windows 10 function activated by touch, though touch is deemed to be \"way cool\" and more up to date, overall a little faster. The Lenovo Website not only has drivers for every OS and internal device, but how-to Videos abound that show you how to do everything! It acts like a real PC. It's got plenty of ports. i5 CPU and 7200 rpm HD is more than adequate for every day usage though there are two easily accessible places to upgrade to ssd for a total of two terabytes! It just works. Two screws and you can upgrade the RAM and even install a PCIe mSata ssd card, or replace the HD with an ssd, one screw and it slides out, no need to open the covers. It uses a special thinner, 2.5 inch drive so you have to make sure you order the right form factor. The CD rom drive also easily slides out in seconds and is user replaceable. These are all FRU's aka Field Replaceable Units. An old IBM term, (I worked for IBM back in the day). The T430 is one of the most durable, versatile PC's I have ever used. It has all the benefits of \"Old School\" but not really old, without some of the shortercomings of some of the new breed of machines heading down the pike. If you wan't a real PC that does everything you want it to do, then the T430 more than fills the bill. Don't really want to dis TabTop users, just that the PC world is vaguely divided between Old School Windows 7 Right Click mouse and keyboard folks and Touchscreen Smartphone folks; kinda like the Demecans and Republicrats. a sveldt 2.2 lb .5 inch thick new machine versus a 6 lb has everything does everything, comes with a built-in cd rom drive, Old School Laptop. My Granddaughters think I'm a dinosaur, but cute, like Barney. Since you won't see them go 5 minutes without checking their iphone, they automatically gravitate towards the newer MacBook Air and Surface Pro. Located along side the memory slot easily accessible by two screws is an mSata slot. I installed a 256 gb Samsung V-NAND SSD 850 EVO mSATA board. They're available up to 1tb. In my machine there was a screw already in the RH locator post. about a ten second operation with two wires that have to be folded out of the way. The Lenovo copper cooling fan located under the keyboard is relatively large and heavy duty. I didn't notice anything other than a slight temperature increase with the ssd installed. I downloaded both the Samsung cloning and Management software, pretty much a no-brainer. I removed the regular 2.5 inch drive and use it for backup and external storage. There is a definite performance boost and the T430 now performs like a machine costing 3x more. The best of both worlds in my opinion, plus it's built like a tank. Some folks are concerned with weight; I don't see where a few pounds can make that much of a real-world difference when used mainly as a desktop or even as a Laptop, but that's just me. Last time I flew in an airplane it was roomy and comfortable, the stewardesses were all under 40, plus you got a meal flying coach, and no nard-groping. TSA to ruin your day. I bought a new 9 cell battery for $40.00 and some Windows 7 and 8.1 recovery disks from ebay. I decided to give Windows 10 a second look and for the first time I used Cortana. My wife is talking into her tablet so I thought I'd give it a try. She's fast and really smart, (i.e. Cortana), my wife, like me is not so fast anymore. A time-saver when browsing the Internet, so I'm going to stick with 10 for a while and see how it goes. Overall, I'm like the cat who ate the canary. I got a really good machine at a really good price. Upon arrival it looked like a machine that had some use, but not bent or beat-up, better than I expected. Doesn't matter much, as nine times out of ten computers either work, or they don't. This one works as good as new and I'm a happy camper.",

Now for the \"drawback\", so to speak, you can not \"Register\" Windows because the operating system is specifically for refurbished units and is not available to register. This means that you can not \"Personalize\" the computer with any other wallpapers or any other way you want to change the appearance. You can however, spend $200 for a Windows 10 license if this is your choice, but personally, I can live with it the way it is, and even if you do, you will still have a Lenovo Think Pad in the neighborhood of $500, which is still very inexpensive as opposed to a brand new unit.

My first purchase attempt through Blazing Prices was a dud. It had a damaged right rear USB port, as if someone had wrenched a drive from the port. Amazon Prime was great and after contacting them I had a return label and my replacement was on the way. Amazon Prime is great - painless returns. When the replacement arrived, here's what I got:. Pros: Clean refurbish job. I had to clean a few keys of what looked like a little peanut butter. No big deal., Other than a few scuffs on the lid, everything looks good. The keyboard is nice and responsive with no worn keys. The speed is fine for office level tasks, Youtube, and social media. I may upgrade the HDD in the near future for an added speed boost and a little more peace of mind, especially given the age of the drive. Cons: The computer was advertised to come with a webcam. Neither one I got from Blazing Prices had a webcam. I will have to buy an external webcam to make up for that deficiency. Also, the battery lasts about 30 minutes. Which is unacceptable. I have already ordered a replacement battery through a different Amazon vendor. Overall, I am ok with it the quality. It's a T430 Lenovo - which is a pretty bullet proof laptop. So, in the interest of getting back to work I am going to stick with it and make it work. Blazing Prices sent several emails asking if I could \"find it in my heart\" to leave them good feedback. This was AFTER a week of going round and round with them. When I first reached out to them, I explained that my first attempt had been returned through Prime, and the second laptop had no webcam and a defective / dying battery, They initially offered to make things right by offering to reimburse for a replacement but never gave specifics. How / who do I send this one back? Will the next one have a decent battery and a webcam? No response. They said \"keep the item\" in one email, then asked in another email they asked if I had returned it. Worse, there is no continuity in a conversation with them. Each email you send appears to go to a different representative. \"David\" sent some official looking emails asking for feedback, but when I responded to his email, my inquiries went right back into the till with an automated response followed by a foggy response from a rep. My last response from them was borderline sarcastic, and still offered no solution. If you don't need a webcam and you don't mind buying a replacement battery, and you have Amazon Prime to ensure a painless replacement if the PC is damaged, this is OK. You might want to shop around to a different vendor. I hope to get a lot of miles out of the computer, but I have no trust in Blazing Prices anymore.",

My unit was equiped with a built-in cellular. radio, which had not been mentioned in the specs. * Came with Windows 10 preinstalled. This could just as easilly be a con,. depending on your feelings for Windows :) I promptly wiped the drive,. installed Linux and discarded the included Windows key. Cons:. * None that would reflect on the seller of this device. Misc:. * My first few attempts to start up the notebook resulted in the Windows 10. equivalent of the BSOD. It simply would not boot. Then I plugged in the. power supply and it started up just fine. * The laptop weighs 6 pounds, which is as much as some full sized laptops.

      "The Lenovo copper cooling fan located under the keyboard is relatively large and heavy duty.": [
        "I really like my Lenovo Thinkpad and I will tell you why. I recently ordered, a new 2 in 1 \"TabTop type PC. It's not like an older PC (Personal Computer) at all. It is basically a Windows 10 Touchscreen Tablet with a keyboard. It only has 1 USB 3.0 Port so if you use a USB mouse you can't plug in a Flashdrive at the same time. It has a USB 3.1 port but I went to Walmart and Best Buy and there is not a single plug in device you can buy that uses USB 3.1 so it is basically useless until new devices come out utilizing the new USB standard The bios is fixed, that means it wont boot from a cd rom, like for installing Windows 7 or 8.1, or even Widows 10. It won't read from a USB CD rom plugged into the USB Port, it just beeps and locks up the the mouse and keyboard. Can't load or play anything from a CD - Nero, Microsoft Office, Mp3, Mp4 music and videos. You're now supposed to download all your \"apps\" from the Microsoft Store. Thinner and lighter is much about phasing out CD based software, so CD software has to be loaded onto flashdrives. Doable but extra time and expense. I wanted to load Ubuntu as a dual boot, can't do it, Windows 10 only. It looks like this machine represents the future \"brave new world of Microsoft\" It is not a Computer like we have gotten used to. You are limited to the world of MS Windows 10 touchscreen as it is basically, more of a tablet aimed at the Smartphone demographic. My wife's Galaxy Tab seems to be as much or more useable for 1/4 the price. If I wanted to ground her all I would have to do is take away her Galaxy. Now, about the Lenovo, just reverse everything I just said. The Thinkpad T430 is a true PC. You can do all of the things you can't do with the Windows Tablet and more. It will run Windows XP, 7, 8.1 and Windows 10. Without a touchscreen, using a mouse you can just about fully duplicate any Windows 10 function activated by touch, though touch is deemed to be \"way cool\" and more up to date, overall a little faster. The Lenovo Website not only has drivers for every OS and internal device, but how-to Videos abound that show you how to do everything! It acts like a real PC. It's got plenty of ports. i5 CPU and 7200 rpm HD is more than adequate for every day usage though there are two easily accessible places to upgrade to ssd for a total of two terabytes! It just works. Two screws and you can upgrade the RAM and even install a PCIe mSata ssd card, or replace the HD with an ssd, one screw and it slides out, no need to open the covers. It uses a special thinner, 2.5 inch drive so you have to make sure you order the right form factor. The CD rom drive also easily slides out in seconds and is user replaceable. These are all FRU's aka Field Replaceable Units. An old IBM term, (I worked for IBM back in the day). The T430 is one of the most durable, versatile PC's I have ever used. It has all the benefits of \"Old School\" but not really old, without some of the shortercomings of some of the new breed of machines heading down the pike. If you wan't a real PC that does everything you want it to do, then the T430 more than fills the bill. Don't really want to dis TabTop users, just that the PC world is vaguely divided between Old School Windows 7 Right Click mouse and keyboard folks and Touchscreen Smartphone folks; kinda like the Demecans and Republicrats. a sveldt 2.2 lb .5 inch thick new machine versus a 6 lb has everything does everything, comes with a built-in cd rom drive, Old School Laptop. My Granddaughters think I'm a dinosaur, but cute, like Barney. Since you won't see them go 5 minutes without checking their iphone, they automatically gravitate towards the newer MacBook Air and Surface Pro. Located along side the memory slot easily accessible by two screws is an mSata slot. I installed a 256 gb Samsung V-NAND SSD 850 EVO mSATA board. They're available up to 1tb. In my machine there was a screw already in the RH locator post. about a ten second operation with two wires that have to be folded out of the way. The Lenovo copper cooling fan located under the keyboard is relatively large and heavy duty. I didn't notice anything other than a slight temperature increase with the ssd installed. I downloaded both the Samsung cloning and Management software, pretty much a no-brainer. I removed the regular 2.5 inch drive and use it for backup and external storage. There is a definite performance boost and the T430 now performs like a machine costing 3x more. The best of both worlds in my opinion, plus it's built like a tank. Some folks are concerned with weight; I don't see where a few pounds can make that much of a real-world difference when used mainly as a desktop or even as a Laptop, but that's just me. Last time I flew in an airplane it was roomy and comfortable, the stewardesses were all under 40, plus you got a meal flying coach, and no nard-groping. TSA to ruin your day. I bought a new 9 cell battery for $40.00 and some Windows 7 and 8.1 recovery disks from ebay. I decided to give Windows 10 a second look and for the first time I used Cortana. My wife is talking into her tablet so I thought I'd give it a try. She's fast and really smart, (i.e. Cortana), my wife, like me is not so fast anymore. A time-saver when browsing the Internet, so I'm going to stick with 10 for a while and see how it goes. Overall, I'm like the cat who ate the canary. I got a really good machine at a really good price. Upon arrival it looked like a machine that had some use, but not bent or beat-up, better than I expected. Doesn't matter much, as nine times out of ten computers either work, or they don't. This one works as good as new and I'm a happy camper.",

For Windows 10, and Microsoft Office, and Internet, works like my brand new and more expensive Lenovo (just had to sacrifice less then a half-inch in depth.) Still very compact, very sturdy, and I think easier to type on. Replaced the battery and lasts over 6 hours on a charge with basic Office use. Great computer and amazing price. Highly recommend for business.",

        "This is not a review of the refurbished unit on sale, but owning this particular laptop. I received one through my job five years ago new and I can say that I wholeheartedly endorse it. I bought it with Windows 7, upgraded it to 10, added a new hard drive and overall it has performed superlatively. I have a tendency to beat up my computers and I can state that this is the toughest laptop I have ever owned. The keyboard has a solid feel and not spongy like traditional laptops. My unit does not have an HDMI port but I bought a USB-HDMI port and it works fine. Couple that with the old school VGA and you can hook it up to anything. Overall, I have high praise for this model Lenovo.",

The keyboard can be lit up, great for working at night. It doesn't need to be taken care of as if its a super expensive computer, I've taken it to many places and it's pretty good at staying protected from anything you might do to it. The only downsides are that when I move the mouse using the trackpad, it sometimes freezes as if the mouse does not detect my fingers, but that could be a setting. Also, the battery life is not the best, but it's good enough for people who take their chargers with them or who don't need to be away from a power source for so long.",

The screen was in new like condition as was the key board (once I cleaned the food crumbs from the spaces surrounding the keys). After powering it on, Cortana (the Windows Virtual Assistant) spoke and walked me through all the steps for set up. It was so easy !! You will need to authenticate the Windows 10 Pro software. When doing so, it will ask for the product key. Turn the laptop over, and there it is on a label affixed to the bottom. Once connected to the internet, I was amazed on how fast this machine is. There is plenty of memory and the processor is quite capable of handling social and business applications. I am not a gamer..so can't comment on that use. Clearly this is an excellent value for the money. The seller, David, at Blazing Prices, sent me a few e-mails to ensure that I was happy and no issues with the laptop. I would recommend this product and would absolutely purchase another product from this seller.",

The graphic's card says it has both NVIDIA NVS 5400M and Intel HD Graphics. Mine only has the Intel Hd 4000 graphics card. Also says it has 2 Processor's mine came with 4! (Witch is a good thing). But other than that Im happy with this computer! I wanted this Laptop so I can record gaming videos with my Elgato card! And it worked really well at 720HD. My other Laptop couldnt handle it. Also has 8GB of Ram so its pretty fast! The backlight works as well!. I would recommend this Laptop for anyone that needs a fast computer for a low price! Just make sure you talk to the seller first before buying! Or you might get something a little different like I did. Says Refurbished but looks New!. I hope this helps!",

      "Two screws and you can upgrade the RAM and even install a PCIe mSata ssd card, or replace the HD with an ssd, one screw and it slides out, no need to open the covers.": [
        "I really like my Lenovo Thinkpad and I will tell you why. I recently ordered, a new 2 in 1 \"TabTop type PC. It's not like an older PC (Personal Computer) at all. It is basically a Windows 10 Touchscreen Tablet with a keyboard. It only has 1 USB 3.0 Port so if you use a USB mouse you can't plug in a Flashdrive at the same time. It has a USB 3.1 port but I went to Walmart and Best Buy and there is not a single plug in device you can buy that uses USB 3.1 so it is basically useless until new devices come out utilizing the new USB standard The bios is fixed, that means it wont boot from a cd rom, like for installing Windows 7 or 8.1, or even Widows 10. It won't read from a USB CD rom plugged into the USB Port, it just beeps and locks up the the mouse and keyboard. Can't load or play anything from a CD - Nero, Microsoft Office, Mp3, Mp4 music and videos. You're now supposed to download all your \"apps\" from the Microsoft Store. Thinner and lighter is much about phasing out CD based software, so CD software has to be loaded onto flashdrives. Doable but extra time and expense. I wanted to load Ubuntu as a dual boot, can't do it, Windows 10 only. It looks like this machine represents the future \"brave new world of Microsoft\" It is not a Computer like we have gotten used to. You are limited to the world of MS Windows 10 touchscreen as it is basically, more of a tablet aimed at the Smartphone demographic. My wife's Galaxy Tab seems to be as much or more useable for 1/4 the price. If I wanted to ground her all I would have to do is take away her Galaxy. Now, about the Lenovo, just reverse everything I just said. The Thinkpad T430 is a true PC. You can do all of the things you can't do with the Windows Tablet and more. It will run Windows XP, 7, 8.1 and Windows 10. Without a touchscreen, using a mouse you can just about fully duplicate any Windows 10 function activated by touch, though touch is deemed to be \"way cool\" and more up to date, overall a little faster. The Lenovo Website not only has drivers for every OS and internal device, but how-to Videos abound that show you how to do everything! It acts like a real PC. It's got plenty of ports. i5 CPU and 7200 rpm HD is more than adequate for every day usage though there are two easily accessible places to upgrade to ssd for a total of two terabytes! It just works. Two screws and you can upgrade the RAM and even install a PCIe mSata ssd card, or replace the HD with an ssd, one screw and it slides out, no need to open the covers. It uses a special thinner, 2.5 inch drive so you have to make sure you order the right form factor. The CD rom drive also easily slides out in seconds and is user replaceable. These are all FRU's aka Field Replaceable Units. An old IBM term, (I worked for IBM back in the day). The T430 is one of the most durable, versatile PC's I have ever used. It has all the benefits of \"Old School\" but not really old, without some of the shortercomings of some of the new breed of machines heading down the pike. If you wan't a real PC that does everything you want it to do, then the T430 more than fills the bill. Don't really want to dis TabTop users, just that the PC world is vaguely divided between Old School Windows 7 Right Click mouse and keyboard folks and Touchscreen Smartphone folks; kinda like the Demecans and Republicrats. a sveldt 2.2 lb .5 inch thick new machine versus a 6 lb has everything does everything, comes with a built-in cd rom drive, Old School Laptop. My Granddaughters think I'm a dinosaur, but cute, like Barney. Since you won't see them go 5 minutes without checking their iphone, they automatically gravitate towards the newer MacBook Air and Surface Pro. Located along side the memory slot easily accessible by two screws is an mSata slot. I installed a 256 gb Samsung V-NAND SSD 850 EVO mSATA board. They're available up to 1tb. In my machine there was a screw already in the RH locator post. about a ten second operation with two wires that have to be folded out of the way. The Lenovo copper cooling fan located under the keyboard is relatively large and heavy duty. I didn't notice anything other than a slight temperature increase with the ssd installed. I downloaded both the Samsung cloning and Management software, pretty much a no-brainer. I removed the regular 2.5 inch drive and use it for backup and external storage. There is a definite performance boost and the T430 now performs like a machine costing 3x more. The best of both worlds in my opinion, plus it's built like a tank. Some folks are concerned with weight; I don't see where a few pounds can make that much of a real-world difference when used mainly as a desktop or even as a Laptop, but that's just me. Last time I flew in an airplane it was roomy and comfortable, the stewardesses were all under 40, plus you got a meal flying coach, and no nard-groping. TSA to ruin your day. I bought a new 9 cell battery for $40.00 and some Windows 7 and 8.1 recovery disks from ebay. I decided to give Windows 10 a second look and for the first time I used Cortana. My wife is talking into her tablet so I thought I'd give it a try. She's fast and really smart, (i.e. Cortana), my wife, like me is not so fast anymore. A time-saver when browsing the Internet, so I'm going to stick with 10 for a while and see how it goes. Overall, I'm like the cat who ate the canary. I got a really good machine at a really good price. Upon arrival it looked like a machine that had some use, but not bent or beat-up, better than I expected. Doesn't matter much, as nine times out of ten computers either work, or they don't. This one works as good as new and I'm a happy camper.",
